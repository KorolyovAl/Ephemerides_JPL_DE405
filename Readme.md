A program for calculating the coordinates and velocities of the planets of the solar system from the NASA ephemeris DE405. All coordinates are calculated relative to the barycenter of the solar system.
For the program to work, ephemeris files need to be placed in the "files/" directory at the root of the project (the path to the files is set in initialization.cpp and reading_ascp.cpp ).The results are saved to the "results/" directory (if there is no such directory, it is necessary to create it).

Additional information about the project can be found in the README directory.
